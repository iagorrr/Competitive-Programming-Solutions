# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome! This repository houses my solutions to competitive programming problems sourced from various platforms and modalities.

This repository is mostly useful for:

- *Resourceful Search:* Quickly find implementations and exercises on specific topics. For example, search for 'segment tree' to access related exercises effortlessly.

- *Support and Guidance:* help those who are stucked in a problem and looking for hints/solutions when there is no editorial yet.

- ~~keep track of my possible progress~~
